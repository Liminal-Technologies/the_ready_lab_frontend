You are my front-end designer and developer.
I already have a working education-platform prototype in this Replit project.
I want you to redesign the UI only—no changes to backend logic, data flow, or routes.

Goal: Make the app look like a modern, premium education SaaS site inspired by the reference screens I have (similar to “Ecudum”):
	•	Large, bold black headlines on white backgrounds
	•	Very light, oversized “ghost” text behind or under the main headline (almost same color as background)
	•	Bright, flat accent colors by section: electric blue, neon/leaf green, warm yellow, soft beige
	•	Big rounded cards and tiles for stats, courses, and testimonials
	•	Soft shadows, smooth hover states, pill-shaped buttons
	•	Lots of white space and big rounded section containers
	•	Clean sans-serif font (system UI / Inter-style)

Very important constraints:
	•	Do NOT change any business logic, API calls, or database code.
	•	Do NOT remove or rename components that are used by the rest of the app.
	•	You may refactor JSX/HTML and CSS/Tailwind for layout and styling only.
	•	Keep all my existing text/content; just present it in the new layout.

What I want you to do:
	1.	Scan this project and identify the main landing / dashboard page(s) for learners.
	2.	For each of those pages, redesign the layout to include:
	•	A hero section at the top:
	•	Big bold headline
	•	Faint “ghost” sub-headline behind or below it
	•	Short paragraph and 1–2 pill buttons
	•	Optional small image/stat/card cluster on the right
	•	A card grid section below the hero:
	•	One large stat card (e.g., % improvement, # of hours saved) on a blue background
	•	Several smaller rounded cards for courses, features, or benefits in a 2–3 column layout
	•	A Programs / Features section on a very light green background with 3–4 feature cards.
	•	A Testimonials section on a warm beige background with 2–3 student quote cards.
	•	A “Stay tuned / Subscribe” CTA section with email input, select/checkbox, and a big yellow pill button.
	3.	Make the whole layout responsive:
	•	Multi-column on desktop, stacked cards on mobile
	•	Maintain generous padding and spacing.
	4.	Centralize the design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in one place (CSS variables, Tailwind config, or a theme file) so it’s easy to tweak later.
	5.	Comment your changes briefly in the code (e.g. // Hero section redesigned, // Ecudum-style card grid) so I can see what was touched.

Now, based on the files in this repo (HTML/React/Vue/etc.),:
	•	Tell me which file(s) you’ll modify first for the main page.
	•	Then show me the updated code for those files with the new UI applied.
