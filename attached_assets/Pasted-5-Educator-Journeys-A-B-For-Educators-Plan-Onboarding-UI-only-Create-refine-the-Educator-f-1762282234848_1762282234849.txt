5) Educator Journeys A & B – For Educators, Plan, Onboarding (UI only)

Create/refine the Educator front-end flows with mock data only.

Desired flow:

“For Educators” landing page: hero section explaining value, 3 benefit cards, and a primary “Explore as an Educator” CTA.

Clicking “Explore as an Educator”:

Open the same auth modal as students, but set user role to educator in local state.

On success, show the normal student Explore pages but with an “Educator Preview Mode” badge and a floating “Create Course” button.

When clicking “Create Course”, open a Plan selection modal:

Cards for FREE / PRO / PREMIUM with bullets exactly as in the PRD.

“Choose plan” buttons just set selectedPlan in local state; for PRO/PREMIUM, show a fake “Stripe subscription” screen with a loader then success.

After plan selection, show an Educator Onboarding form:

Name, photo (preview only), bio.

Expertise tags (multi-select chips).

Teaching styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing) as selectable pills.

Preferred content types (microlearning, deep learning, live, products).

“Save & Continue” → Educator Dashboard.

Educator Dashboard shows an onboarding checklist (Create profile, Create first course, Upload first lesson, Submit for review) with checkmarks that update as actions are completed (state only).

Constraints:

No Stripe or real upload; UI only.

Use comments where backend/payment would eventually plug in.

Implement/modify the For Educators page, plan modal, onboarding form, and basic educator dashboard checklist.

6) Educator Journey C – Course Builder Wizard (UI only)

Build the 5-step course builder wizard as a front-end-only experience.

Steps:

Course Type: radio cards for Microlearning, Deep Learning, Digital Product.

Course Details: Title, Category dropdown, Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), Description, Learning Objectives (multi-line or dynamic bullet fields).

Pricing: Free / Paid toggle, price input, and a static “platform fee” + “your earnings” calculation based on the PRD percentages.

Upload Content:

Drag-and-drop area for videos (no real upload; show fake filenames and durations).

Buttons to “Generate thumbnails” and “Generate captions (EN/ES)” that just show spinners then success badges.

Simple interface to group uploaded items into modules/lessons (local state).

Review & Submit:

Show a summary preview card of the course as a student would see it.

Buttons: Save Draft and Submit for Review.

On submit, show a “Submitted for review” confirmation screen mimicking a moderation step.

Constraints:

Everything is client-side; no calls to S3, transcription, or moderation.

Put clear TODO comments where backend integrations will go.

Implement the wizard as a multi-step component and route it from the educator dashboard “Create New Course” button.

7) Educator Journey D & E – Dashboard + Live Events (UI only)

Create a visual educator dashboard and live event flow as a demo.

Dashboard:

Stats cards with mock numbers: Students enrolled, Lessons completed, Avg rating, Revenue this month.

Table of students with name, avatar, % progress, at-risk badge (mock logic based on progress).

Section for “Latest questions” from discussion boards with a way to click and view a thread (fake).

Simple charts (can be static using CSS or a small chart library already used in the repo) for completion by lesson and revenue trend.

Live events:

“Schedule Live Event” button on dashboard → opens a form: Title, description, date, time, duration, max attendees, associated course dropdown, checkboxes for Chat/Q&A/Polls/Recording.

On submit, show a fake “Event created” card and list it under “Upcoming Events”.

Clicking an event goes to a Live Event page with:

“Go Live” button that opens an embedded video area (placeholder frame) and a right-side chat/Q&A panel with mock messages.

When “End Stream” is clicked, show a success screen and a “Recording available soon” message that later turns into a “Watch Replay” link.

Constraints:

Use placeholders instead of Daily.co; just show the layout.

All data in local/global state.

Implement these views and connect them to existing educator navigation.
