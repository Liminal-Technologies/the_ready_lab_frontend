1) Student Journey A – Discovery → First Lesson (UI only)

Implement/refine Student Journey A: Discovery → First Lesson as a pure front-end demo.

Desired flow (all fake / local state is fine):

Visitor lands on the homepage and can scroll/browse courses with no login.

Clicking Enroll on any course opens an Auth modal (Google / Email buttons – just simulate success).

After “sign up”, show a 3-screen onboarding wizard:

Screen 1: Multi-select interests (Funding, Infrastructure, Branding, Finance, Legal, AI) using pill buttons with on/off states.

Screen 2: Language select (English / Español) – store in local/global state and show somewhere in the UI as “Current language”.

Screen 3: Optional profile (name, photo upload, short bio). The photo input can just preview a local image, no upload. Include Skip button.

After onboarding, show a Welcome overlay / 4-step dashboard tour using tooltips or a simple stepper.

Then land on a Student Dashboard with a “Recommended for You” row that filters static mock courses based on selected interests.

Constraints:

No real auth or uploads. When user clicks “Continue with Google” or “Sign up”, just close the modal and move to onboarding.

Courses can be hard-coded mock data.

Use comments where future APIs will go.

Edit or create the relevant components (homepage, auth modal, onboarding, dashboard) and return the full updated code.

2) Student Journey B & C – Enroll → Course Player (UI only)

Build/refine the enroll + course player flow as a front-end demo—no real payments.

Desired flow:

On the Course detail page, show:

Mock preview video (YouTube embed or placeholder), curriculum outline, instructor bio, Price (“Free” or “$199 / Included in subscription”).

A primary Enroll Now button.

Clicking Enroll Now:

If course is marked free: instantly show a toast/pop-up “Enrolled!” and navigate to the Course Player page.

If course is paid:

Show a fake Stripe Checkout modal with card icons + BNPL options.

Clicking “Pay” after a short loading spinner simply closes the modal and navigates to the Course Player with a “Payment Successful” message.

Course Player UI (front-end only):

Center video player with play/pause, fake progress bar, and speed control (0.5x–2x) that just adjusts a label.

Caption selector (English / Español / Off) that updates state and a small “CC: ES” indicator; no real subtitle files needed.

Right sidebar: module/lesson list with checkmarks. Clicking lessons just switches mock content.

Below video: tabs Overview | Resources | Notes | Discussion with tab switching implemented.

Notes tab: text area that saves to local state and persists while page is open.

Discussion tab: simple comment thread using mock data + ability to add a new comment in local state.

When the fake video progress reaches 95% (you can simulate with a button like “Mark lesson complete”), mark the lesson as complete in state and show progress on the sidebar and dashboard.

Constraints:

Do NOT call real Stripe; everything is fake UI.

Use mock data arrays for curriculum, comments, etc.

Add // TODO: backend comments where real logic would go.

Update the Course Detail and Course Player components and return the full code.

3) Student Journey D – Certificate (UI only)

Build a certificate experience demo so the client can click through it, no real PDF generation.

Desired flow:

When a mock course reaches “100% complete” in state, show a “Certificate unlocked!” dialog with a View Certificate button.

Certificate page:

Show a nicely styled certificate card with: student name, course title, completion date, fake serial number, and a QR-code placeholder image (static SVG or png).

Buttons: Download PDF, Share to LinkedIn, Copy verification link – these can just show toast messages like “Pretend PDF downloaded”.

From the dashboard, add a “My Certificates” section listing earned certificates with a View button that routes to this certificate page.

Constraints:

Everything stays on the front-end; no real PDF or email.

Use hard-coded or locally generated serials and dates.

Add TODO comments where real certificate generation and email would go.

Implement the certificate page, its routing, and the dashboard “My Certificates” UI and return the updated code.

4) Student Journey E – Community (UI only)

Build a community experience demo with fake data.

Desired flow:

After earning the first certificate, show a banner or modal on the dashboard: “Join the Ready Lab community”.

Clicking it opens a Communities page:

Cards for topics: Funding, Legal, Marketing, Branding, Infrastructure, AI.

Each card has a Join / Leave button that toggles in local state.

Clicking a community opens a Community detail view:

Title, description, “Joined” badge.

A list of posts (mock data) with rich-looking text, timestamps, and small avatars.

Ability to create a new post via a textarea and “Post” button (local state).

Each post supports comments (expand thread), likes/reactions counters (state only).

A side panel section “Upcoming Live Q&A” with fake event cards.

Constraints:

All posts & membership stored in component/global state only.

No backend; treat it as a UI walkthrough.

Implement pages/components for the community list and detail, plus the dashboard prompt, and return the full code.
