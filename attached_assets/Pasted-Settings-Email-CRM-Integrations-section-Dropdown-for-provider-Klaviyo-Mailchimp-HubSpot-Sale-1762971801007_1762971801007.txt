Settings


Email / CRM Integrations section:


Dropdown for provider (Klaviyo/Mailchimp/HubSpot/Salesforce/Custom Webhook).


“Connect” button opens a modal to simulate OAuth; on “Complete” set provider connected.


Field mapping UI: app fields → CRM fields (email, firstName, lastName, segment/tags).


Send Test Email button calls sendTestEmail() (stub) and shows toast.




Roles & Collaborators:


Page to add collaborators: email, role (Super Admin/Admin). On “Invite”, show pending invites list with Resend/Cancel (stub).


Editable role per collaborator with guard rails (cannot downgrade self).




General: Platform branding, logo upload (stub), theme toggle (light/dark).




Questions to facilitate later (place as inline help tooltips):


Where do disable/shutdown actions live? → In Communities and Users tabs + mirrored shortcuts in Settings.


What is the workflow for deactivating a student vs. educator? → Disable user (retains data), or archive (hard stop), with re-enable action.



STUDENT DASHBOARD (/student)


Home


Cards: Current courses, Recommended, Certifications.




Certifications


Show certificates as stylish cards with “razzle dazzle”: add subtle gradients, embossed borders, holographic shimmer on hover, and a “Not an accredited educational cert — certificate of completion” disclaimer.


Click opens a Certificate Modal with:


certificate preview,


Download (stub, generates PNG via canvas),


Share (stub),


Close button (IMPORTANT: previously missing — must add!) and Esc to close.






Settings → Profile


Allow profile pic upload (client-side preview only in demo). Persist to mock store.


Fix any background color issues that make text disappear (use high-contrast neutrals).


Editable fields: name, headline, bio, socials; Save shows toast.




Sign out


Visible in top-right user menu; routes to /.





EDUCATOR DASHBOARD (/educator)


Quick Actions


Edit Profile opens a modal with full form and Close/Cancel buttons (was missing).




Schedule Live Event


If not working, implement as a usable form:


Title, Description, Date picker, Time (dropdown: 30-min increments), Time Zone (PST, MST, CST, EST, UTC selection).


Delivery: Virtual (URL) or In-Person (address).


Capacity, Visibility (Public/Private/Unlisted).


Create Event saves to mock store; show success toast and appear in “Upcoming Events.”






Create Course


Existing layout looks great; extend with:


Microlearning Duration: range 30 seconds → 10 minutes (input with min/max validation; both seconds and minutes UI acceptable).


Learning Style: multiselect (e.g., Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Read/Write, Project-based).


Pricing:


Toggle Free / Paid.


If Paid, show Price and a Fee Breakdown explainer:


“Price” → “Platform Fee (x%)” → “Processing (Stripe est.)” → “Educator Share (net)”.


Provide an info tooltip that this is illustrative; actual analytics will live in Sales Analytics.




Integrate with Stripe stub: “Create Checkout Session (Demo)” button appears and toasts a success message with a fake session id.




AI features (already present): keep AI-generated caption and thumbnail buttons, but pipe to stub functions returning mock text/image.




Add a Sales Analytics (Preview) tab for educators:


Show mock charts/tables: views, add-to-cart, purchases, conversion rate, revenue share, refunds (all seeded from mock).


Filters by date range.







Interaction Rules (No Dead Buttons)


Every visible button must:


Navigate to a route, open a modal/side panel, trigger a toast, or run a stubbed async action.




Add loading states for all async stubs (Stripe connect, email connect, send test, create event, save course, etc.).

Implement all of the above now as a front-end demo. Keep integration points modular with clear TODOs. Do not remove any existing working copy; refactor incrementally and leave helpful comments.
