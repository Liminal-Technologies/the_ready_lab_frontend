Course Approval: Auto-publish or require admin review? (Recommendation: Auto with moderation API)
Teaching Styles: How do teaching style tags affect platform? (Not defined in journey map)
AI Roadmap: Launch blocker or Phase 2? (Recommendation: Phase 2, use manual recommendations)
Digital Products: Just templates/PDFs, or integrate with Shopify/Etsy?
Debarment: Required for MVP or compliance feature for Phase 2?
Institution Onboarding: Manual for first 3 partners, or build self-service?
Certificate Approval: Instant or admin approval? (Recommendation: Instant for paid, approval for free)
Content Questions:
When will 5 learning tracks have actual lesson content?
Who creates Spanish translations/captions?
Timeline for Compton contract - what do they need specifically?
Technical Questions:
Transcription: Deepgram or AssemblyAI?
Video storage: Keep all in hot storage or move old videos to Glacier after 30 days?
