8) Institution Journeys – For Institutions + Admin (UI only)

Build a demo experience for institutions with front-end only.

Flow A – Inquiry & Sales:

“For Institutions” page: hero, 3–4 value prop cards, and CTA buttons: Request Demo and Contact Sales.

“Request Demo” opens a modal or separate page with the inquiry form from the PRD (org name, contact info, type, areas of interest, number of users, custom requests, optional debarment checkbox).

Submitting the form shows a confirmation screen: “Thanks, our team will reach out” with a fake Calendly embed or link.

Flow B – Institution Admin:

Mock Institution Admin Dashboard reachable via a separate route (e.g., /institution-demo).

UI sections:

CSV upload UI (no parsing needed – just show a fake “20 students imported” message).

Cohort creation form (name, start/end dates, assign courses via multiselect).

Table listing cohorts with progress bars and stats columns.

“Send invitations” button that triggers a modal summary “Invites sent to 20 students” with sample email text.

Download/report section with fake CSV download buttons.

Constraints:

No backend; everything is static or local state.

Just enough to demo what an institution admin would see.

Implement these pages and hook them into the main nav or a “For Institutions” link.

9) “Watch Demo” style polish prompt

Do a UI/UX polish pass across the app focused on making the demo feel real, similar to the “Watch Demo” Rick Roll behavior:

Whenever a journey would require a backend, show convincing placeholders: loading spinners, success toasts, confirmation screens, and simple “summary” modals.

Ensure every main CTA in the PRD actually does something visible: opens a modal, moves to the next step, or updates the UI state.

Standardize buttons, badges, cards, and typography so the whole app feels like one cohesive product.

Add small explanatory text where needed (e.g., “This is a demo view – actual data will appear here”).

Touch the minimum number of files necessary; focus on clarity of the flows.
When you’re done, list the main journeys a demo user can click through from the homepage.
