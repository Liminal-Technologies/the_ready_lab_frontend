You are my senior front-end engineer. Implement a clickable demo of the following flows with mocked data/services only (no real back end). Keep code clean and production-ish. Use React + TypeScript + React Router, Tailwind, and componentized UI. Add clear TODOs and integration stubs where APIs will connect later (Stripe, email/CRM, auth).

Global Requirements

Design/Accessibility

Fix any text contrast issues: audit all pages where white/very-light backgrounds are causing low contrast (e.g., “Admin Overview”). Ensure AA contrast for text and interactive elements.

Create a light + dark theme toggle; default to light with readable neutrals. Use bg-neutral-50/100, text neutral-800, and utility classes to guarantee contrast.

Add a reusable Modal with header, body, footer, Close (X) and Cancel actions everywhere a modal appears.

Add toast notifications for success/error.

Add a shared ConfirmDialog component for destructive actions (disable user, close community, etc.).

Navigation & State

React Router layout: /super-admin/*, /student/*, /educator/*.

Add a persistent top nav with role switcher for demo purposes (no real auth). Include Sign out (routes to /).

Add a useMockAuth() hook to “log in” as Super Admin / Educator / Student; store role in memory.

Data

Use a simple mock store (/src/mocks/) with JSON for communities, users, courses, payouts, certifications, events.

Provide a MockApi service that returns promises with small delays to simulate async.

Integration Stubs

Stripe: Add a StripeStub.ts with functions: connectAccount(), getAccountStatus(), createCheckoutSession(). Include .env placeholders: VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..." (do not expose secrets). UI should show “Connected”/“Not Connected” from stubbed state.

Email/CRM: Add EmailCrmStub.ts with connectProvider(provider: 'HubSpot'|'Salesforce'|'Klaviyo'|'Mailchimp'|'Custom'), sendTestEmail(), mapFields(). Add a “Mapping” UI for first name/last name/email/segments/tags. Show provider status badges.

Collaborators & Roles: Role model: Super Admin, Admin, Educator, Student. Build a RolesGuard component and a “Collaborators” manager (mock invite flow).

SUPER ADMIN AREA (/super-admin)

Create a dashboard with tabs/cards for:

Overview

Fix background/text so “Admin Overview” is clearly legible.

KPIs (mock): active communities, pending approvals, total students, monthly GMV, Stripe status, email provider status.

All buttons on the page must work (navigate, open modal, or trigger toast). No dead buttons.

Communities

Table of communities: Name, Owner, Members, Status (Active, Disabled, Archived), Created date, Actions.

Row actions:

Disable Community → opens ConfirmDialog explaining effects (hides from search, blocks posts, notifies owner). On confirm, set status to Disabled and show toast.

Shut Down (Archive) → stronger confirmation; requires typing the community name; sets status Archived, disables all activity.

View → opens side panel with details and recent activity (mock).

Bulk actions (checkbox select): Disable / Archive (confirm).

Filter by status; search by name/owner.

Users

Unified list with filter for Student / Educator / Admin.

Row actions: Disable User, Re-enable, Reset Password (stub).

For disabling: require reason dropdown + notes; reflect status badge on row.
