I already have a working Courses / Browse page, but I want to completely redesign the layout and styling to look like the reference UI I’ll describe, while keeping all the same text/content.

Important rules

Do NOT change any course titles, descriptions, prices, durations, instructors, or labels – only the layout and visual design.

Do NOT add real backend filtering or search; use front-end state with mock behavior.

Keep the existing routing and data structures; only refactor JSX/HTML and CSS/Tailwind.

Target layout (match this style):

Full-width white page with rounded top corners and a light gray page background.

Top toolbar above the grid:

Breadcrumb like “Home › Courses”.

Big heading: “Browse Courses & More” (use my existing heading text).

Small text showing number of courses (can be derived from the data length or hard-coded).

Right side: Filter button (for mobile), and a Sort By dropdown.

Under the heading, a horizontal row of category chips (pills) for main topics (use my existing categories/tags). Clicking a chip just filters locally.

Main content split into two columns:

Left sidebar (filters):

“Filter” heading.

Filter groups like Category, Price range, Level, Format, etc., using checkboxes and sliders – wired only to local filtering.

A primary “Save Filter” button at the bottom.

Right grid (courses):

3- or 4-column responsive grid of course cards.

Each card shows course image, duration, level/tag pills, title, subtitle/short description, instructor, and key stats (students, rating) using my existing fields.

Cards have large border radius, soft shadow, hover elevation, and consistent spacing like the reference.

Below the grid, add pagination controls (Previous / page numbers / Next) that work in local state only.

At the bottom of the page, add a wide orange CTA banner similar to the reference:

Left: headline + short paragraph encouraging users to keep learning with The Ready Lab.

Right: friendly instructor image (use my existing assets or a placeholder) and a “Join for Free” or equivalent primary button.

Keep or restyle the existing footer to be dark with multiple columns (Account, Resources, Contact, etc.) like the reference.

Responsive behavior

On desktop: show sidebar + grid.

On tablet/mobile: hide the sidebar by default and expose filters through the top “Filter” button that opens a slide-over / modal.

Now I will paste my current Courses page component(s). Please:

Rewrite the layout and styling to match this design.

Implement local filtering, chip selection, and pagination using my existing course data.
