I want to redesign only the “Learn from Industry Experts / Join a Community / Built for Every Learner” section of my homepage.
The goal is to keep all of the existing text exactly the same, but change the layout and styling so it matches the style of this reference layout:

Large statement at the top: small green label line, then a huge 2-line headline (black + bright green) like “Expand beyond introductory education.”

Below that, a rounded light-green panel that contains multiple cards in a clean grid.

Cards are white, large border-radius, soft shadow, and plenty of padding.

Overall look: minimal, airy, with lots of white/green space and bold typography.

Map my current content into this layout:

Use “Built for Every Learner” as the main big headline (like the reference’s “Expand beyond introductory education”).

Use the paragraph that starts with “We know every learner is different…” as the supporting text under the headline.

Put a small green label above the headline (e.g., “Learning styles” – or reuse my existing text if there is a similar label).

Inside the rounded light-green panel:

Convert “Learn from Industry Experts” and “Join a Community” into two prominent feature cards on the first row, each with its current image, title, bullet points, and stats.

On the row below, place the four learner-type cards:

Visual learners

Auditory learners

Reading/Writing learners

Kinesthetic learners

Keep all their descriptions exactly as they are now; just restyle the cards.

Keep the closing line “This isn’t passive learning — it’s learning that sticks.” as a subtle line below the panel, centered.

Design rules:

Do NOT change any routing, logic, or component props. Only adjust JSX/HTML structure and styling (CSS or Tailwind).

Use a white background for the section, with a large, rounded light-green container behind the cards, similar to the reference.

Headline: very large, bold, left-aligned; second line can be bright green for emphasis.

All cards: white, rounded corners, soft shadow, hover effect, and responsive grid (2–3 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile).

Make sure the layout is fully responsive and maintains comfortable spacing.
