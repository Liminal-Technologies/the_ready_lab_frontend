I want to redesign only the “Real Results from Real People” homepage section.
The goal is to keep all of the existing text exactly the same, but change the layout and styling so it looks like the modern card-mosaic hero in the reference image (Ecudum).

Current content that must stay the same:

Section heading: “Real Results from Real People”

Testimonial cards (names + subtitles), e.g.:

Sarah M. – Raised $500K for nonprofit

Tech Startup – $2M Series A secured

Maria L. – Built $1M social enterprise

Stat block: “95% Success Rate”

Subtext: “Graduates achieve goals within 12 months”

New layout I want (Ecudum-style):

A top hero row on a white background:

On the left:

A small label in a bright accent color (e.g., “Success stories”).

A very large bold headline “Real Results from Real People”.

Faint, oversized “ghost” text behind or underneath the headline (e.g., “real results”) in very light gray.

A short supporting sentence using the existing success-rate text or a brief summary, but don’t invent new claims.

On the right: a compact stacked layout that highlights the 95% Success Rate and the “Graduates achieve goals within 12 months” line, styled like a stat card.

Below the hero, a rounded, light background panel (off-white or very pale color) containing:

A mosaic/grid of the 3 testimonial cards, each as a large rounded tile: full-bleed image, dark gradient overlay, and the existing name + subtitle text.

Cards should have big border radius, soft shadows, and hover effects.

Design rules:

Do NOT change any routing, data, or business logic. Only adjust JSX/HTML structure and styling (CSS or Tailwind).

Keep all text exactly as it is now.

Use a clean sans-serif font, lots of white space, and pill/rounded elements, similar to the Ecudum hero.

Make the layout responsive:

On desktop, hero text and stat block appear side-by-side with testimonial cards in a 3-column grid below.

On mobile, stack hero elements vertically and show testimonial cards in a single column.
