## Demo Tips & Best Practices

### Before the Demo:
1. **Prepare sample institution data** (name, logo, colors)
2. **Have CSV file ready** with 50-100 sample users
3. **Pre-load 3-5 courses** to assign
4. **Create 2-3 cohorts** with different dates
5. **Generate sample reports** to show quickly
6. **Test SSO/LTI integrations** if showing

### During the Demo:
1. **Lead with pain points:** "Managing 1,000 learners in spreadsheets is impossible..."
2. **Show ROI:** "Our clients see 3x completion rates vs. traditional LMS"
3. **Emphasize ease:** "CSV upload means setup in minutes, not days"
4. **Highlight support:** "Dedicated account manager and 24/7 support"
5. **Address compliance:** "FERPA, GDPR, 508 compliant out of the box"

### Demo Flow Optimization:
- **15-minute version:** CSV upload → Course assignment → Analytics dashboard
- **30-minute version:** Full user management + cohorts + reporting
- **60-minute version:** Complete admin journey + SSO setup + Q&A
- **90-minute version:** Technical deep-dive with IT team present

### Common Questions to Prepare For:

**Q: "What's the implementation timeline?"**
A: Typically 2-4 weeks:
- Week 1: Branding, SSO setup, admin training
- Week 2: User import, course assignment, testing
- Week 3: Pilot with small cohort
- Week 4: Full rollout

**Q: "Can we migrate content from our old LMS?"**
A: Yes! We have migration tools for:
- SCORM packages
- Video content (MP4, MOV)
- User data (CSV)
- Grades and transcripts
Usually takes 1-2 weeks depending on volume.
